## vector.to.Matlab

Generation of a random vector

```{r}
myVec<-rnorm(1000,0,12)
```

Test of the function `vector.to.Matlab(x,vect.name) which return a vector easy to copy past in *Matlab* from a vector written in *R*.

```{r}
my.vec<-vector.to.Matlab(myVec)
```

It is easy to write the vector in a txt file:

```{r}
write(my.vec,file="my_vec.txt")
```
